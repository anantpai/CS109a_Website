# <center> GROUP 12: SPOTIFY </center> 

<center> Welcome to our homepage! We're so excited to present the first iteration of the Spotify Regressor (TM) </center>

<center> Group Members: Anant Pai, Andy Kim, Katherine Cohen, Trevor Noon </center>

## Motivation

> <center> Our project centers around the analysis of Spotify curated playlists. Taking an analytical and data driven approach, we sought to understand what factors lead to playlist success in the form of followers. From that point, we sought to use this predictive understanding to create a model that generates potentially 'successful' playlists for a given user. </center> 

Here is *emph* and **bold**.

Here is some inline math $\alpha = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}$ and, of-course, E rules:

$$ G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu}  = 8 \pi T_{\mu\nu} . $$
