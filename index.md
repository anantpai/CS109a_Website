<center> Welcome to our homepage! We're so excited to present the first iteration of the Spotify Regressor (TM) </center>

**Group Members:** Anant Pai, Andy Kim, Katherine Cohen, Trevor Noon

## <center> Motivation </center>

> <center> Our project centers around the analysis of Spotify curated playlists. Taking an analytical and data driven approach, we sought to understand what factors lead to playlist success in the form of followers. From that point, we sought to use this predictive understanding to create a model that generates potentially 'successful' playlists for a given user. </center> 

## <center> Problem Statement </center>

<center> More specifically, we refined this into a two stage problem statement more clearly defining the term 'successful': </center>

> <center> 1. Predicting number of followers that a playlist will have using combinations of
the above predictors that were seen to have varying degrees of association with playlist
success, and using appropriately transformed variables </center>

> <center> 2. Generating our “own” successful playlist. Our goal is now to create a playlist
that we will project to have at least 200 thousand followers. This will place our playlist
well within the top quartile of Spotify playlists, which includes any playlist over 163
thousand followers. </center>

<center> This broke our project down into three areas: modeling for prediction with regression, continuing that modeling with classification given the 200K follower cutoff, and finally the playlist generation itself. The final end goal is to create a playlist predicted to have at least 200K followers. </center>
