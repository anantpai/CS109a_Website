    "Our journey in model creation had a variety of different phases as we iterated through the process running into roadblocks, circled back to try a different method or approach, and then repeated. Looking at an overview of what that actually meant for us we can briefly trace the outline of our steps and then walk through it.\n",
    "1. Initially, we ran various regressions (linear and regularization-based) on approximately 70 predictor variables. Despite multiple efforts we could not find any model that performed well.\n",
    "2. Adjusting for this, we went back to our data and bolstered it with additional indicators, interaction terms, and unique predictors we intuitively thought were useful. Running the same models on this data, we still had poor performance (even on our best cross validated Ridge Regression model).\n",
    "3. Thinking our data was still being negatively effected by the skew of playlist followers, we decided to only look at the popular playlists that we ultimately are seeking to generate. Using our new bolstered dataset on this subset, we saw mildly improved performance, but nothing substantial enough to gain incredible insights from.\n",
    "4. Moving away from regression, we decided to switch our focus to classification instead. We defined a success as being known as a 'popular' playlist above our follower threshold and undertook numerous classification models. Ultimately, a Random Forest Classification model proved to be the best model for us throughout the entire journey. "

    "One of the goals of our project was to be able to predict the number of followers of a playlist, given a number of songs and their artists. Our first, and simplest predictive model was the Ordinary Least-Squares Multiple Linear Regression Model, which aims to minimize the error produced by a linear function of our predictors. In this case, error is defined by taking the mean of our squared residuals (the actual number of followers - our predicted number). This linear function of our predictors provides us with a simple equation relating our predictors, such as average artist popularity or song duration, to our response variable, the number of followers of a playlist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of this simple model is that it’s highly interpretable and easy to understand. However, due to the simplicity of the model, there are definitely assumptions that we must account for.\n",
    "1. Normality: our residuals should be normally distributed. We check this below using a residual vs. fitted plot.\n",
    "2. Equal Variance: We should have the same variance with each observation; we can also check this below with the residual plot below.\n",
    "3. Linearity: Our predictors should have a linear relationship with our response; we can observe whether this is violated by checking to see if there are any patterns or any curvature in the residual plot below. Additionally, we saw some of these relationships directly in our EDA. \n",
    "4. Independence: Our predictors should be linearly independent, if not, there is multicollinearity in our model. We can account for this by removing predictors that are highly correlated."

We know that we're overfitting the data because all of our training set $R^2$ values are incredibly high around 0.9, but the test and cross validated $R^2$ values were either 0 or even negative."

    "Despite the overfitting problem, we want to look and see if linear regression is even a good fit at all and whether or not we violate any of the assumptions necessary for a model like this to work. Generally, for linear regression to be valid we want data that is normally distributed. As discussed in the EDA section, playlist followers are heavily right skewed so we performed a log transformation. Even with this transformation, however, the data was still rather far from normal which caused some reverberating problems throughout our models. Additionally, there were no directly apparent linear relationships present between our predictors and response variables nor any visible helpful transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the models themselves, we can see if their inherent assumptions held. The first assumption for our model to be valid is that our residuals are normally distributed with mean 0 and a constant variance. Looking at the distribution of our residuals we can see that the mean is indeed 0, however they don't look like they have constant variance as we have far more positive residuals than negatives. Indeed, looking at our fitted values for log followers when compared to the true number of followers, as well as a quantile-quantile plot we tend to generally predict far too many playlists to be located around the mean of the true dataset."

    "Despite the fact that we violated some key assumptions, we looked further into linear regression to try and remedy the overfitting problem. Utilizing backwards stepwise regression and eliminating insignificant predictors, we hoped to address the problem. With that said, however, we were unsuccessful as we still experienced overfitting. This may seem strange since now there are only 14 predictors, but in examining the predictors the overfitting becomes clear. It makes absolutely no sense to have a significant variable of the interaction between Dua Lipa's presence in a playlist and the amount of country that it has to effect success by an enormous factor of $e^{70}$."

    "Moving away from pure linear regression, we looked for better success with regularization methods - specifically Lasso and Ridge regression. The main difference between the OLS regression and these regularization methods are that they both introduce a penalty factor. The methods still inherently minimize a loss function (to minimize error), but the penalty factors serve to account for extreme values in parameters. Lasso's penalty form relies on the absolute value of the coefficients while ridge uses the square of the coefficients (notice how both must be positive to increase the loss function and actually serve as a penalty). \n",

Ultimately, these regularization methods did address the overfitting, but had little performance improvement as a result. "
